            <p>
                CauseNet aims at creating a causal knowledge base that comprises all human causal knowledge and to separate it from mere causal beliefs, with the goal of enabling large-scale research into causal inference.

# CauseNet: Towards a Causality Graph Extracted from the Web

Causal knowledge is seen as one of the key ingredients to advance artificial intelligence. Yet, few knowledge bases comprise causal knowledge to date, possibly due to significant efforts required for validation. Notwithstanding this challenge, we compile CauseNet, a large-scale knowledge base of *claimed* causal relations between causal concepts. By extraction from different semi- and unstructured web sources, we collect more than 11 million causal relations with an estimated extraction precision of 83\% and construct the first large-scale and open-domain causality graph. We analyze the graph to gain insights about causal beliefs expressed on the web and we demonstrate its benefits in basic causal question answering. Future work may use the graph for causal reasoning, computational argumentation, multi-hop question answering, and more.

## Download

We provide three versions of our causality graph CauseNet:
- [CauseNet-Full](https://groups.uni-paderborn.de/wdqa/causenet/graphs/causenet-full.jsonl.bz2): The complete dataset
- [CauseNet-Precision](https://groups.uni-paderborn.de/wdqa/causenet/graphs/causenet-precision.jsonl.bz2): A subset of CauseNet-Full with higher precision
- [CauseNet-Sample](https://groups.uni-paderborn.de/wdqa/causenet/graphs/causenet-sample.json): A small sample dataset for first explorations and eperiments without provenance data

## Statistics

|                    |  Relations | Concepts   | File Size |
| -------------------| ---------: | ---------: | --------: | 
| CauseNet-Full      | 11,609,890 | 12,186,195 |     1.8GB |
| CauseNet-Precision |    199,806 |     80,223 |     135MB |
| CauseNet-Sample    |        264 |        524 |      54KB |

## Data Model

The core of CauseNet consists of causal concepts which are connected by causal relations. Each causal relation has comprehensive provenance data on where and how it was extracted.

## Examples of Causal Relations


Causal relations are represented as shown in the following example. Provenance data is omitted.

```json
{
    "causal_relation": {
        "cause": {
            "concept": "disease"
        },
        "effect": {
            "concept": "death"
        }
    }
}
```

For CauseNet-Full and CauseNet-Precision, we include comprehensive provenance data. In the following, we give one example per source.

For relations extracted from natural language sentences we provide:
For relations extracted from natural language sentences we provide:
- `surface`: the surface form of the sentence, i.e., the original string  
- `path_pattern`: the linguistic path pattern used for extraction

## Loading CauseNet into Neo4j

We provide [sample code](data/load-into-neo4j.ipynb) to load CauseNet into the graph database [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/).

The following figure shows an excerpt of CauseNet within Neo4j (showing a coronavirus causing the disease SARS):

## Concept Spotting Datasets

For the construction of CauseNet, we employ a causal concept spotter as a causal concept can be composed of multiple words (e.g., “global warming”, “human activity”, or “lack of exercise”). We determine the exact start and end of a causal
concept in a sentence with a sequence tagger. Our training and evaluation data is available as part of our [concept spotting datasets](https://groups.uni-paderborn.de/wdqa/causenet/concept-spotting): one for Wikipedia infoboxes, Wikipedia lists, and ClueWeb sentences. We split each dataset into 80% training, 10% development and 10% test set
